# Creating a PR

Just create a new pull request if you want to make an update.

We recommend you create an issue if one doesn't already exist, and continue the conversation on the issue to get more info/alignment on what to build.


# Issues

Spotted a bug? Has deployment gone wrong? Do you have user feedback? Raise an issue for the fastest response.

... or pick up and fix an issue if you want to do a Pull Request.

## Issues with paid features

We prefer not to accept external contributions for paid features. If you don't see the feature on your local build, it's most probably paid.

# Feature requests

Raise an issue for these and tag it as an Enhancement. Please give as much context on the why as possible.

# Features

We don't, yet, have a prescriptive roadmap laid out.

As a rule of thumb - if it fits with helping developers understand product usage, we'll generally like it.

If you are at all unsure, just raise it as an enhancement issue first, and we'll very quickly respond.
