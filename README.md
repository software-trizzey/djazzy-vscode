*Djangoly highlights Django best practice violations and offers immediate, actionable recommendations for fixing them, streamlining your development process.*

## What's this thing do?

Djangoly is a powerful VS Code extension designed to help teams enforce Django best practices and coding conventions. Our tool ensures that your Django projects adhere to established best practices and team-defined conventions, reducing review cycles and improving code quality.

## Features (MVP) ‚ú®

- **Django N+1 Query Detection**: Identifies potential N+1 query issues in Django projects, flagging instances where related field access occurs within loops without proper optimization.
- **Django-Specific Linting**: Automatically check your Django code against best practices and common pitfalls.
- **Test Suite Conventions**: Notify developers to add or update test files when changes are detected in Django views or models.
- **Redundant Comment Detection**: Flags comments that do not contribute additional information or context to the code.

## Security Checks (MVP) üîí
Djangoly includes several security checks to help ensure your Django project follows best practices for security:

1. **DEBUG Setting:** Checks if `DEBUG` is set to `True`. This setting should be `False` in production environments.
2. **SECRET_KEY Protection:** Verifies that the `SECRET_KEY` is not hardcoded in your settings file.
3. **ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration**: Checks the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting for potential security issues.
4. **COOKIE Settings**: Ensures the `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` settings are set to `True` for production environments.

These security checks help you identify common configuration mistakes that could lead to security vulnerabilities in your Django application. Djangoly provides warnings and recommendations to help you maintain a secure Django environment, especially when preparing for production deployment.

## How Djangoly Improves Your Code üßë‚Äçüè´

### 1. N+1 Query Detection and Optimization

Before:
```python
def list_books(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    for book in books:
        print(f"{book.title} by {book.author.name}")  # This causes N+1 queries
```

After:
```python
def list_books(request):
    books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()
    for book in books:
        print(f"{book.title} by {book.author.name}")  # No additional queries
```

Djangoly detects the potential N+1 query issue and suggests using `select_related()` to optimize the database queries.

### 2. Security Settings Check

Before (in settings.py):
```python
DEBUG = True
SECRET_KEY = 'my_secret_key'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
```

After (with Djangoly warnings):
```python
DEBUG = False  # Djangoly: Ensure DEBUG is False in production
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')  # Djangoly: Use environment variables for sensitive data
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com', 'www.example.com']  # Djangoly: Specify allowed hosts explicitly
```

Djangoly identifies potential security risks in your Django settings and suggests safer alternatives.

### 3. Test Suite Conventions

Before (missing test file):
```python
# app/views.py
def important_view(request):
    # Some important logic here
    pass

# No corresponding test file
```

After (with Djangoly reminder):
```python
# app/views.py
def important_view(request):
    # Some important logic here
    pass

# app/tests/test_views.py (Djangoly suggests creating this file)
from django.test import TestCase

class TestImportantView(TestCase):
    def test_important_view(self):
        # Djangoly: Remember to add tests for the important_view function
        pass
```

Djangoly reminds you to create and update test files when you modify your Django views or models.

### 4. Redundant Comment Detection

Before:
```python
# This function adds two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    # sum these numbers
    return a + b
```

After (with Djangoly suggestion):
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    # Djangoly: Consider removing redundant comments
    return a + b 
```

Djangoly identifies comments that don't provide additional context and suggests removing them to improve code readability.

## Quick Start üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

1. **Get an API Key**: If you don't already have an API key, you can signup for one via this [form](https://forms.gle/gEEZdfhWpQyQh2qVA).
1. **Install the Extension**: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alchemized.djangoly)
2. **Set Up Your Django Project**: If you haven't already, set up a Django project in your workspace.
3. **Configure Django Settings**: Open the extension settings in VS Code and configure your Django-specific settings.
4. **Start Coding**: Begin developing your Django project. The extension will automatically start analyzing your code.
5. **Review Suggestions**: Check the Problems panel in VS Code for Django best practice suggestions and quick fixes.

## Key Django Features üéØ

### Django N+1 Query Detection

Automatically identifies potential performance issues related to database queries. For example:

```python
# This code will be flagged as a potential N+1 query
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # Accessing a related object inside a loop

# Suggested optimization
books = books.select_related('author')
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional queries
```

### Daily Usage Limit
To ensure fair usage and maintain service quality, we've implemented a daily limit for N+1 query validations:

- **Limit**: *200 requests per day*
- **Reset**: The limit resets at midnight UTC
- **Exceeding the limit**: Once you reach the daily limit, you'll receive a notification, and N+1 query detection will be temporarily unavailable until the next day
- **Tracking**: The limit is tracked per API key, so each user has their own daily allowance

This limit helps us provide a consistent and reliable service to all our users while allowing for extensive use of the N+1 query detection feature during your development process.

If you find that you consistently need more than 200 validations per day, please contact us at [support@djangoly.com](mailto:support@djangoly.com) to discuss your needs.

## Understanding N+1 Query Scores üìä

Djangoly uses a scoring system to help you prioritize and address potential N+1 query issues in your Django project. Here's what you need to know:

### What do the scores mean?

- **Score Range**: 0-100
- **Severity Levels**:
  - 0-30:   üí° Hint (Low priority)
  - 31-60:  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Information (Medium-low priority)
  - 61-89:  üî∂ Warning (Medium-high priority)
  - 90-100: üõë Error (High priority)

The higher the score, the more likely the issue is to cause performance problems in your application.

### How are scores calculated?

Scores are based on several factors:

1. **Query in a loop**: Highest weight. Performing database queries inside loops is a common cause of N+1 problems.
2. **Use of write methods**: High weight. Write operations in loops can be particularly inefficient.
3. **Use of query methods**: Moderate weight. Certain query methods (like `filter`, `get`, etc.) used inefficiently can lead to N+1 issues.
4. **Related field access**: Lower weight. Accessing related fields without proper optimization can cause extra queries.
5. **Use of aggregate methods**: Lowest weight. While not always problematic, inefficient use of aggregate methods can contribute to N+1 issues.
6. **Bulk operations**: Score reduction. Bulk operations are generally more efficient, so their presence reduces the overall issue score.

The exact weights for each factor are configurable and may be adjusted based on ongoing analysis and user feedback.

### How to address N+1 query issues

1. **For high-scoring issues (Warning/Error)**:
   - Review the flagged code carefully.
   - Consider using `select_related()` or `prefetch_related()` to optimize queries.
   - Restructure loops to avoid repeated database calls.

2. **For medium-scoring issues (Information)**:
   - Evaluate the context of the query. Is it in a performance-critical part of your application?
   - Look for opportunities to optimize, but balance with code readability.

3. **For low-scoring issues (Hint)**:
   - These are often suggestions for potential optimizations.
   - Address them if you're working on optimizing that specific area of code.

### Example and Fix

```python
# High-score issue (Error):
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # Accessing a related object inside a loop

# Fix:
books = books.select_related('author')
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional queries
```

### Best Practices

- Always test performance improvements with real data.
- Use Django's `prefetch_related()` for many-to-many relationships.
- Consider using `django-debug-toolbar` to identify N+1 queries in development.
- For complex scenarios, batch processing or custom SQL might be necessary.

Remember, while addressing N+1 queries is important for performance, it's also crucial to maintain code readability and maintainability. Always consider the trade-offs when optimizing.

For more detailed guidance on optimizing Django queries, check out the [Django documentation on database optimization](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/optimization/).
