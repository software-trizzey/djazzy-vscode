# Djangoly: Write Cleaner, Faster, Scalable Django Code

Djangoly is an extension built for Django developers that works with both [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/). It uses static analysis to ensure your project aligns with Django best practices and conventions. You can install the extension via the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alchemized.djangoly) or by searching for `djangoly` in your IDE's extension tab.

> Note: Djangoly requires _Python 3.9_ or higher to function properly. Please ensure your environment meets this requirement before using the extension.


## Get started for free

Djangoly is open source, and you are free to fork and host your own version of the extension. We encourage contributions and feedback from the community.

However, for the best experience and to access support, we recommend using the [official VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alchemized.djangoly). In the future, we plan to introduce paid features to support the ongoing development and maintenance of the extension.


## Docs

Djangoly implements a comprehensive set of rules to help you write cleaner, safer, and more efficient Django code. Each rule is designed to catch common pitfalls, enforce best practices, and improve the overall quality and security of your Django projects.

For a complete list of all rules, including detailed descriptions and examples, please refer to our [Convention Rules Documentation](https://github.com/software-trizzey/djangoly-vscode/blob/main/docs/CONVENTION_RULES.md).


## Djangoly highlights

### 1. Flag annoyances such as `CharField(null=True)` omitting `related_name` for foreign keys etc.
