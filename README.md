*Djangoly highlights Django N+1 queries and offers immediate, actionable recommendations for fixing them, streamlining your development process and improving performance.*

## What's this thing do?

Djangoly is a powerful VS Code extension designed to help teams enforce Django best practices and coding conventions. Our tool ensures that your Django projects adhere to established best practices and team-defined conventions, reducing review cycles and improving code quality.

## Features (MVP) ‚ú®

- **Django N+1 Query Detection**: Identifies potential N+1 query issues in Django projects, flagging instances where related field access occurs within loops without proper optimization.
- **Django-Specific Linting**: Automatically check your Django code against best practices and common pitfalls.
- **Test Suite Conventions**: Notify developers to add or update test files when changes are detected in Django views or models.
- **Redundant Comment Detection**: Flags comments that do not contribute additional information or context to the code.

## Security Checks (MVP) üîí

Djangoly includes several security checks to help ensure your Django project follows best practices for security:

1. **DEBUG Setting:** Checks if `DEBUG` is set to `True`. This setting should be `False` in production environments.
2. **SECRET_KEY Protection:** Verifies that the `SECRET_KEY` is not hardcoded in your settings file.
3. **ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration**: Checks the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting for potential security issues.
4. **COOKIE Settings**: Ensures the `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` settings are set to `True` for production environments.

These security checks help you identify common configuration mistakes that could lead to security vulnerabilities in your Django application. Djangoly provides warnings and recommendations to help you maintain a secure Django environment, especially when preparing for production deployment.

## How Djangoly Improves Your Code üßë‚Äçüè´

### 1. N+1 Query Detection and Optimization

Before:

```python
def list_books(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    for book in books:
        print(f"{book.title} by {book.author.name}")  # This causes N+1 queries
```

After:

```python
def list_books(request):
    books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()
    for book in books:
        print(f"{book.title} by {book.author.name}")  # No additional queries
```

Djangoly detects the potential N+1 query issue and suggests using `select_related()` to optimize the database queries.

### 2. Security Settings Check

Before (in settings.py):

```python
DEBUG = True
SECRET_KEY = 'my_secret_key'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
```

After (with Djangoly warnings):

```python
DEBUG = False  # Djangoly: Ensure DEBUG is False in production
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')  # Djangoly: Use environment variables for sensitive data
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com', 'www.example.com']  # Djangoly: Specify allowed hosts explicitly
```

Djangoly identifies potential security risks in your Django settings and suggests safer alternatives.

### 3. Test Suite Conventions

Before (missing test file):

```python
# app/views.py
def important_view(request):
    # Some important logic here
    pass

# No corresponding test file
```

After (with Djangoly reminder):

```python
# app/views.py
def important_view(request):
    # Some important logic here
    pass

# app/tests/test_views.py (Djangoly suggests creating this file)
from django.test import TestCase

class TestImportantView(TestCase):
    def test_important_view(self):
        # Djangoly: Remember to add tests for the important_view function
        pass
```

Djangoly reminds you to create and update test files when you modify your Django views or models.

### 4. Redundant Comment Detection

Before:

```python
# This function adds two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    # sum these numbers
    return a + b
```

After (with Djangoly suggestion):

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    # Djangoly: Consider removing redundant comments
    return a + b 
```

Djangoly identifies comments that don't provide additional context and suggests removing them to improve code readability.

## Django N+1 Query Detection üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Djangoly includes a powerful static analysis tool to help identify potential N+1 query issues in your Django projects. This feature examines your code to flag instances where database queries might be inefficiently executed within loops.

### How It Works

The N+1 query detector performs a static analysis of your Django code, focusing on:

1. Identifying loops in your functions
2. Detecting database query operations within these loops
3. Recognizing optimized querysets using `select_related()` or `prefetch_related()`
4. Scoring and categorizing potential issues based on their severity

### Key Features

- **Static Analysis**: Analyzes your code without execution, providing quick feedback during development.
- **Loop Detection**: Identifies various types of loops where N+1 queries often occur.
- **Optimization Recognition**: Acknowledges when `select_related()` or `prefetch_related()` are used to optimize queries.
- **Severity Scoring**: Assigns a score to each detected issue, helping you prioritize optimizations.

### Understanding N+1 Query Scores

Each detected N+1 query issue is assigned a score from 0 to 100, indicating its potential impact:

- **0-40**: Hint (Low priority)
- **41-70**: Information (Medium-low priority)
- **71-94**: Warning (Medium-high priority)
- **95-100**: Error (High priority)

Scores are calculated based on factors such as:

- Presence of query operations inside loops
- Use of write methods (create, update, delete) which may exacerbate the performance impact
- Complexity and multi-line queries (e.g., when queries span multiple lines of code)

### Limitations and Best Practices

While our N+1 query detector is a valuable tool, it's important to understand its limitations:

1. **Static Analysis**: As a static tool, it cannot account for runtime behavior or dynamic query construction.
2. **False Positives/Negatives**: The tool may occasionally flag optimized queries or miss some complex N+1 scenarios.
3. **Context Limitation**: It may not fully understand the broader context of your entire application.

Best practices when using this feature:

- Use it as an initial check to identify potential problem areas.
- Always verify flagged issues in the context of your application logic.
- Combine with runtime analysis tools (like Django Debug Toolbar) for comprehensive optimization.
- Consider the trade-off between query optimization and code readability.

### Example and Fix

```python
# Potential N+1 query issue:
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # This might trigger additional queries

# Optimized version:
books = books.select_related('author')
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional queries
```



### Final thoughts

Remember, while addressing N+1 queries is important for performance, it's also crucial to maintain code readability and maintainability. Always consider the trade-offs when optimizing.

For more detailed guidance on optimizing Django queries, check out the [Django documentation on database optimization](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/optimization/).
