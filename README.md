## What's this thing do?

When In Rome is a code stylist that helps teams enforce their coding conventions, reducing review cycles and improving code quality. Our tool ensures that the code adheres to team-defined conventions before submission, saving everyone valuable time.

## Features ‚ú®

- **AI-Driven Name Recommendations**: Automatically check variable and function names against your team‚Äôs coding conventions, ensuring consistency and readability.
- **Quick Fix Suggestions**: Receive suggestions to fix naming and style violations directly in your IDE, with options to apply changes immediately or review them first.
- **Configurable Rules**: Simple rule configurations are available directly within the extension settings panel, allowing you to customize naming and style guidelines to match your team's standards.
- **Redundant Comment Detection**: Automatically flags comments that do not contribute additional information or context to the code below them, helping to keep your codebase clean and efficient. Comments marked with '@rome-ignore', 'TODO', or 'FIXME' are intelligently ignored to preserve necessary notes.
- **Test Suite Conventions**: Notify developers to add or update test files when changes are detected in API views. *MVP: Triggers for files within "api" or "views" folders.*
