# Djazzy: Write Cleaner, Faster, Scalable Django Code

> **Heads up:** The project formerly known as "Djangoly" is now "Djazzy". This change was made to ensure compliance with the Django foundation's trademark policies, especially as we consider paid features. The new name, "Djazzy", pays homage to Django's namesake, the jazz musician Django Reinhardt, while incorporating the silent 'D' to maintain a connection to Django-specific code.

## What is Djazzy?

[Djazzy](https://djazzy.dev) is the open-source tool that helps Django developers write better code. It leverages static analysis and various IDE features to ensure your project aligns with Django best practices and conventions.

Djazzy helps you:

- Catch style violations like poor names and redundant queryset methods
- Remind you to create/update test files when you modify your Django views or models
- Identify potential security risks in your settings and suggest safer alternatives
- Ensure that your URLs follow the Django project's naming convention
- Automatically resolve migration conflicts (planned)
- Suggest valid field lookups (__gte, __in, etc.) when filtering QuerySets (planned)
- Autocomplete named URLs in reverse() and redirect() calls (planned)


## Djazzy highlights

### Flag annoyances such as `CharField(null=True)` omitting `related_name` for foreign keys etc.
