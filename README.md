*When In Rome highlights Django best practice violations and offers immediate, actionable recommendations for fixing them, streamlining your development process.*

## What's this thing do?

When In Rome is a powerful VS Code extension designed to help teams enforce Django best practices and coding conventions. Our tool ensures that your Django projects adhere to established best practices and team-defined conventions, reducing review cycles and improving code quality.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Django-Specific Linting**: Automatically check your Django code against best practices and common pitfalls.
- **Django N+1 Query Detection**: Identifies potential N+1 query issues in Django projects, flagging instances where related field access occurs within loops without proper optimization.
- **Quick Fix Suggestions**: Receive suggestions to fix Django-related issues directly in your IDE, with options to apply changes immediately or review them first.
- **Test Suite Conventions**: Notify developers to add or update test files when changes are detected in Django views or models.
- **AI-Driven Name Recommendations**: Ensure consistency and readability in your Django codebase with AI-powered naming suggestions.
- **Redundant Comment Detection**: Automatically flags comments that do not contribute additional information or context to the code.
- **Configurable Rules**: Customize naming and style guidelines to match your team's standards directly within the extension settings panel.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Support**: While focusing on Django, the extension still supports linting and best practices for JavaScript and TypeScript files commonly used in modern Django projects.

## Quick Start üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

1. **Install the Extension**: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Alchemized.when-in-rome)
2. **Set Up Your Django Project**: If you haven't already, set up a Django project in your workspace.
3. **Configure Django Settings**: Open the extension settings in VS Code and configure your Django-specific settings.
4. **Start Coding**: Begin developing your Django project. The extension will automatically start analyzing your code.
5. **Review Suggestions**: Check the Problems panel in VS Code for Django best practice suggestions and quick fixes.

## Key Django Features üéØ

### Django N+1 Query Detection

Automatically identifies potential performance issues related to database queries. For example:

```python
# This code will be flagged as a potential N+1 query
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # Accessing a related object inside a loop

# Suggested optimization
books = books.select_related('author')
for book in books:
    print(book.author.name)  # No additional queries
```

### Django ORM Best Practices

Suggests optimizations for your ORM usage:

```python
# This query will be flagged
users = User.objects.filter(is_active=True).order_by('-last_login')[:10]

# Suggested optimization
users = User.objects.filter(is_active=True).order_by('-last_login').select_related('profile')[:10]
```

## Configuration üß™

### Django-Specific Settings

- **Enable/Disable Django Linting**: Toggle Django-specific linting on or off.
- **Django Version**: Specify your Django version to receive version-specific recommendations.
- **Custom Django Apps**: Configure custom Django app names for more accurate linting.
- **N+1 Query Detection Sensitivity**: Adjust the sensitivity of N+1 query detection.

### General Settings

2. **Quick Fixes for Django Issues**: Offers actionable recommendations for quick corrections of Django-specific issues.
3. **Django N+1 Query Detection**: The extension analyzes your Django code to identify potential N+1 query issues.
4. **Test Suite Enforcement**: Alerts you to update or create tests following changes in Django views or models.
5. **JavaScript/TypeScript Support**: Continues to provide linting and best practice suggestions for JS/TS files in your Django project.

## Known Issues & Limitations üêû

- **Initial Language Support**: Currently, Python (Django), JavaScript, and TypeScript are supported.
- **False Positives**: As an MVP undergoing rapid development, When In Rome may generate inaccurate diagnostics and recommendations. If you encounter any issues, please report them to [support@rome.dev](mailto:support@rome.dev).
- **Django N+1 Query Detection**: The current implementation focuses on simple loop structures and may not catch all complex scenarios. It may produce some false positives in cases where optimizations are applied outside the immediate function scope. The detection is based on static analysis and may not account for dynamic query optimizations.
