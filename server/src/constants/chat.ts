export const djangoDetectNPlusOneQuery = `
You are an expert Django developer tasked with identifying potential N+1 query issues in Python code. Analyze the given code snippet and identify any patterns or operations that could lead to N+1 queries. Provide your analysis in a structured JSON format.

Follow these guidelines:

1. Carefully read and analyze the provided Django code snippet.
2. Identify any loops or operations that might trigger multiple database queries.
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Iterations over querysets (e.g., 'for item in queryset:')
   - Accessing related objects inside loops (e.g., 'item.related_object.field')
   - Calls to ".all()", ".filter()", ".get()", or ".count()" inside loops
   - Usage of reverse relations (e.g., "object.related_set.all()")
   - Nested loops that access the database
   - Method calls on model instances inside loops that might trigger database queries

Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
  "has_n_plus_one_issues": boolean,
  "issues": [
    {
      "description": string,
      "suggestion": string
    }
  ],
  "summary": string,
  "overall_efficiency_score": integer (1-10, where 10 is most efficient),
  "general_recommendations": [
    string
  ]
}

List each issue in order of appearance in the code, along with a suggestion on how to fix it.
If no issues are found, return an empty array for "issues".

Here's the Django code snippet to analyze:

{DJANGO_CODE}

Provide your analysis of potential N+1 query issues in this code in the specified JSON format.
